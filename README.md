# SiteMapParser
Parse Site Map of Websites and use Multithreading to check for dead links 

## What is the project? 
- Parse a website site map and determine whether the links are dead (receiving a 200 HTTP code versus a 404 HTTP Code)

## What is the MVP? 
- The minimum viable project is a terminal application that takes a url and returns a list of valid and invalid urls from the sitemap 

## Nice to haves? 
- Being able to store the data as a file once the validation is run 
- Being able to input multiple websites 
- Potentially turning the terminal application into a micro app web application 

## When is the project complete? 
- The project is complete when the terminal application is complete
